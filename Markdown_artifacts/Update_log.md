# Update log
This is a place where I can keep a log, for myself and others, of what has been going on. We must spend time on our tasks to advance in them, and it behooves us to let others know we are  doing so

##2024/09/29:
Relocating is quite disruptive, all the minutia of life, once automatic and sorted, now must be rediscovered, resolved, reset. But that is done, and I return to my scheduled targets.

###Current goals:

1. Implement the basic SOM, and in the process make the framework which will house all the variants of the mechanisms which differentiate the family of models I will be investigating.

2. Compose and add to the list of target models. The proposal names several target models, but I must read more to complete the list and defend the cut-off points.

3. Establish a regular update schedule. Updates are communications, to ourselves and others, they are used to track progress, but such tracking must be frequent to be valuable. We will target weekly updates here.
