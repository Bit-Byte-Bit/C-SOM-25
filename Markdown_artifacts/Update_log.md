# Update log

This is a place where I can keep a log, for myself and others, of what has been going on. We must spend time on our tasks to advance in them, and it behooves us to let others know we are  doing so

## 2024/09/29:

Relocating is quite disruptive, all the minutia of life, once automatic and sorted, now must be rediscovered, resolved, reset. But that is done, and I return to my scheduled targets.

### Current goals:

1. Implement the basic SOM, and in the process make the framework which will house all the variants of the mechanisms which differentiate the family of models I will be investigating.

2. Compose and add to the list of target models. The proposal names several target models, but I must read more to complete the list and defend the cut-off points.

3. Establish a regular update schedule. Updates are communications, to ourselves and others, they are used to track progress, but such tracking must be frequent to be valuable. We will target weekly updates here.

Work will require a familiarity with both **Docker** and **Git**. This is fortuitous as these technologies are core to my development for this project. I will soon be able to set my schedule at work as expected, which will facilitate a full return to the project as planned.

### Development:
- To take advantage of the significant parallelism inherent in SOMs, GoLang has been selected as the language in which the project will be implemented.
- To achieve a realistic test of streaming, containerization will be used to create a framework wherein SOM implementations will recieve a datastream.
- We have elected to purchase a more powerful computer to facilitate rapid iteration.
- Gitlab will be used to manage development in the near future.
  
### Time-managment:

- We are learning agile development from [The Art of Agile Development, 2nd ed.](https://www.amazon.com/Art-Agile-Development-James-Shore/dp/1492080691), particularly:
    - Chapters [1-3]
    - Subsections of chapter 7
    - Chapters [8-16]
- We've opted into a high nutrient density, low volume meal-plan that should minimize the time spent in food-prep and eating, leaving more time for project work.
- We've stabalized a schedule that will facilitae ***~33.5 hrs a week*** deveoted to the dissertation, though the week of 2024/10/07 will be disrupted due to new-employee training reseduled due to hurricane Helen.
