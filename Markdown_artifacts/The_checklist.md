# Motivations.
This checklist is a living way of tracking project requirements in an easy to read an organized way. The procedural checklists advocated by Atul Gawande in *The Checklist Manifesto* are not preciely what we have here, which is closer to the "to-do list", but we include his advocacy nevertheless.

>"Four generations after the first aviation checklists went into use, a lesson is emerging: checklists seem able to defend anyone, even the experienced, against failure in many more tasks than we realized. They provide a kind of cognitive net. They catch mental flaws inherent in all of usâ€”flaws of memory and attention and thoroughness. And because they do, they raise wide, unexpected possibilities." - Atul Gawande, *The Checklist Manifesto*

# The list
## Done
- [x] Defend proposal.
- [x] Initilize github-repo.
- [x] Learn Markdown.
- [x] Aquire Agile methodology documentation.


## To Do
- [ ] Complete an implementation catalog of salient error modulated plasticity, and cost modulated contractile, mechanisms as seen across continual domain SOMs.
    - [ ] Construct the C-SOM-25 library.
    - [ ] Per mechanism, quantiativley answer the following questions using a standardized set of CL and SOM metrics, and salient datasets:
        - Are these mechanisms able to perform a set of standard SOM tasks? 
        - Do they consistently perform the tasks they were presented on? 
        - Can they perform our task? 
        - When they can perform, at what expense of runtime, memory, and stability?
- [ ] Create a reciprocal replay buffer strategy using the SOM as the source and selector for the buffer's occupants, and use it to maintain cluster identities under conditions of data-drift.
    - [ ] Replay buffer that accounts for the SOM architecture. 
    - [ ] Quantiatively answer the following questions using propper CL/SOM metrics:
        - How long can these systems remember something?
        - How well? 
        - At what cost?
- [ ] Integrate these mechanisms with the GSOM and GHSOM.
- [ ] Test the ingerated system on the fully online anomaly detective problem.
