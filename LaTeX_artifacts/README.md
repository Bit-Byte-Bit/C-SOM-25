The `.tex` and `.zip` files in this directory constitute one of two major deliverables for the **C-SOM-25** project.

## The `.zip` files
- *A Briefing on Narrative...*:
    This is an Overleaf project `.zip` file that documents heuristics and practices for writing academic journal/conference articles. The document ***does NOT*** constitute the official position of the CSE-dept. of MSU, or any affiliated organization.
- *Template_for_thesis...*:
    This is an Overleaf project `.zip` file containing a variant of the official CSE-dept. thesis/dissertation template. It ***has NOT*** yet been officially checked or sanctioned by the dept. or the library at MSU.
- *My_diss_from_template.zip*:
    This will contain an updated version of my own dissertation as I conduct it.
